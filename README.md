## üîç Overview

**TripGuardian** is a real-time travel disruption assistant. It listens for flight delays, cancellations, or extreme weather and recommends smart, actionable alternatives‚Äîsuch as rebooking, switching airlines, or nearby hotels‚Äîso you‚Äôre never left stranded.

## üß† How it Works

1. **Input**: A user submits their flight itinerary and status (delay times, weather, etc.)
2. **Analysis**: The system predicts how disruptive the issue is using a trained ML model.
3. **Recommendation**: The engine suggests the best next step (rebook, wait, exit airport, etc.)
4. **Response**: FastAPI returns the plan to the user, in real-time.
